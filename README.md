# ScalaForTheImpatient
My solutions to the Scala 2.12 coding exercises in [Cay Horstmann](https://horstmann.com/)'s excellent manual [Scala for the impatient](https://www.amazon.com/Scala-Impatient-2nd-Cay-Horstmann/dp/0134540565), which I strongly recommend for Scala learners to buy!

Notes:
- This is ongoing work; I will publish more exercises as I do them.
- In some exercises, I deliberately exceed the requirements by using concepts that are dealt with in later chapters.
- Every chapter is an executable App in itself, but you can also execute all chapters together - or just command-line specified chapters - with the App AllBook.scala.
- All exercise outputs, chapter by chapter, are visible [here](https://github.com/stefperf/ScalaForTheImpatient/blob/master/output/AllBook.txt).
